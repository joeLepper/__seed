An AngularJS / NodeJS jumping-off point.


Getting started
===============
* Clone the repo to your desired location
* cd into the directory (ex: `cd __seed`)
* `npm install` and wait for the required files to download
* if you haven't installed GulpJS before `npm install -g gulp`
* `gulp` and open http://localhost:8888 in your browser (you'll also notice a separate instance of Chrome open up â€“ this is where Karma is running its tests)
* Or if you want to do it all at once: `npm install -g gulp && git clone git@github.com:joeLepper/__seed.git && cd __seed && npm install && gulp`
